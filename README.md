# Shipping Port Operations Cost Management Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting ship delays at a port using Machine Learning (ML) to optimize operational costs and resource allocation. Efficient scheduling and cost management are crucial for maintaining smooth port operations and reducing financial losses caused by delays.

## Business Understanding
Delays in ship arrivals and departures can lead to significant consequences, including bottlenecks, increased operational costs, and customer dissatisfaction. Managing ship schedules efficiently ensures that port activities run smoothly.

### Why Cost Management is Important
Accurate prediction of ship delays allows the port authority to plan operations effectively, reducing unnecessary changes and adjustments. This leads to better resource allocation and minimizes financial waste.

Example:
If the cost of handling one ship is IDR 10,000,000 and 80 ships need to be managed daily, the port authority requires at least IDR 800,000,000 each day for smooth operations. However, if only 30-40 ships actually arrive, the port authority risks losing around IDR 400,000,000 in unnecessary expenditure.

### Precision
In this project, the delayed ships are labeled as `1` and the on-time ships as `0`. The port authority aims to accurately predict the ships that will arrive on time, making precision the key metric to focus on.

## Data and Methodology
This section would describe the data used for the predictions, including sources, features, and preprocessing steps. It would also outline the Machine Learning models employed and the evaluation metrics used, with an emphasis on precision.

## Results
A summary of the key findings and results, demonstrating how the model's predictions can help the port authority allocate resources more efficiently and reduce unnecessary costs.

## Conclusion
By implementing this ML-based approach, the port can save significant amounts in operational costs, allowing the reallocation of resources to other strategic areas.

## How to Use
Instructions on how to clone the repository, set up the environment, and run the project would be provided here.

## Future Work
Suggestions for future improvements, such as incorporating real-time data, enhancing model accuracy, or expanding the scope of predictions to other port operations.
